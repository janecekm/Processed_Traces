# Processed_Traces

All traces are taken from this publically available set: https://zenodo.org/records/437170
It contains traces for 9 different benchmarks. In each case, there are 31 different runs using 3 different tracing configurations (for a total of 93 different traces). I've included .csv versions of the "all-events" configuration. 

Due to file size limitations, each trace is broken up into files of at most 100000 events. The files are named run[run #]_[section #].csv.

Note that some fields can be blank (e.g. not all events have a tid)
